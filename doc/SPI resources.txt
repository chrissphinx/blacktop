The data sheet is a good place for information for our specific board, start with these links then read that section of the data sheet.
You will also need to look at the data sheet for the EEPROM as it will outline the SPI protocol it uses.

Good resource from Ti that is a broad overview of how SPI works

Another good resource describing SPI and potential issues that can arise with the communication

Another resource showing how to setup SPI, it is about an arduino, but has nice logic analyzer images of how SPI looks. Also has a decent overview
