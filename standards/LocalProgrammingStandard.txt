We will follow the Barr C coding standard as our overarching standard


GENERAL

The GPL license should be included in the header of every src and test file that we create

All functions need to validate the input they are receiving

No more than one statement per line

Line length should not exceed 100 characters

Test classes must start with the name of the class they are testing followed by 'Test'

NEVER use a GOTO statement, this is unacceptable


VARIABLES

One character variable names should only be used in loops or for temporary variables

Variables should be named in a way that helps the reader understand what they are used for

Local variables should begin with a lowercase letter and be camel cased (e.g. localVar)

Globals should be used sparingly, but when they are used their names should begin with a capital letter (e.g. Global)

Constant variables should be named in all capital letters. (e.g. CONST)

You should avoid the use of numbers in names unless absolutely necessary


FUNCTIONS

The names of functions should be written in camel case starting with a lower case letter (e.g. findSum)

The name of functions should describe the reason for the function to be used


INDENTATION

There must be a space after giving a comma between two function arguments

You should set you editor to use proper tabs and NOT spaces

Each nested block should be properly indented and spaced

Proper indentation should be at the beginning and at the end of each block in the program
