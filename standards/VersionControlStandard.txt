The repository can be found at https://github.com/thenniges/blacktop.git

All development should be done on the dev branch and then be moved to master when it is reviewed by team members
You can clone the dev branch with the following command:

git clone --single-branch --branch dev https://github.com/thenniges/blacktop.git

If you feel that the code should be reviewed and moved to the master branch talk to the team leader.
The team leader is the only person who is allowed to merge to the master branch.

All code that is pushed to the repository should have a complete test suite and should be passing all tests.
You should run the unit tests for all of the modules before pushing as well and ensure all tests pass. 
You are responsible for fixing any tests that are not passing.
Commenting out tests is not acceptable, find the problem and fix it. Ask for help if you don't understand what another developer's code is doing or you are stuck.
You should not push to the repository while any tests are failing.

You should not ignore merge conflicts.
When you get a merge conflict you should pull any changes. This can be done with the following command:

git pull

If there is still a merge conflict after pulling, figure out what has changed and make changes to your local files to make it compatible before uploading it.
